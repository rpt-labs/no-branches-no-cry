When you open up that SA or TA repo and realize it doesn't have student branches added...

# No branches? No cry!

Instead of cursing, start conjuring! Magic at your fingertips!

## Just edit `branches.txt` with the branch names. One per line.

### Then run `. ./script.sh`

Pro tip! Need the exact exact path to the folder with the .git file?
Navigate with `cd` into the folder, and use `pwd | pbcopy`.
Now you can paste the exact path!

### Rejoice! Your fingers are about 357 keystrokes younger than they would have been!
